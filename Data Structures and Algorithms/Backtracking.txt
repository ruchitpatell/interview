Backtracking

If you are able to built a state space tree (requiring all possible solutions), 
Backtracking is usually the approach.

Choices, Constraints, and Goals.

Generic approach pseudocode

function backtrack(candidate): 
	if is_solution(candidate): 
		process_solution(candidate) 
	else: 
		for choice in generate_choices(candidate): 
			if is_valid(choice): 
				make_choice(choice) 
				backtrack(candidate) 
				undo_choice(choice)
